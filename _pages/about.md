Computational mechanics engineer focused on fiber-reinforced polymer composites. I develop and implement multiscale fracture, progressive damage, and fatigue methods in in-house C++ FE codes, supported by Python/MATLAB workflows for efficient pre/post-processing. Strong communicator with experience presenting complex results to technical and non-technical audiences.
